            <p>Hi how are you? My name is Damon Rocha and I am 23 years old. I Love to build anything, such as software, robots, basic electronics, arrowheads, knive, and much more!</p>
            <p>I have been coding for about five years now, and can say I have thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.</p>
            <p>I recieved my degree in Computer Science in 2019 at Grayson County college, learned a lot of physics, math, Computer Assembly, C++, and various other subjects.</p> 
            <p>Upon completing my degree I decided to start the Flatiron Bootcamp, and I am now experienced in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript-based programming, and React.</p>
            <p>Due to the amount of math, I took in college I have a detailed Math, Calculus, and Physics background centered around electronics and science.</p>
            <p>And to wrap it all up I possess strong skills in team-building and project management that I gained in working with UPS and as a supervisor at Kohls.</p>
            <p> So if this all sounds good let's talk about why I would be a good fit at your company. Thanks</p>
