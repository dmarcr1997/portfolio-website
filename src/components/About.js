            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi my name is Damon Rocha and I am 23 years old. I am a passionate tinkerer, and love to build things with my hands. Such as software, robots, basic electronics, arrowheads, knives, and much more!</p>
            <p>I have been coding for about three years now, and can say I have thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.</p>
            <p>I recieved my degree in Computer Science in 2019 at Grayson County college. While here I studied Physics, Math, Calculus, Computer Assembly, C++, and various other subjects.</p> 
            <p>Upon completing my degree I decided to start the Flatiron Bootcamp. After six months of work, I finished the program and am now experienced in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript-based programming, and React.</p>
            <p>In conclusion I would be a great fit at any company that would have me. I possess strong skills in team-building and project management which I gained while working at UPS and as a supervisor at Kohls.</p>
            <p> So if this all sounds good sned me an email. Thank you</p>
        </div>)
